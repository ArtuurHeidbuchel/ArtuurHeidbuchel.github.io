<h1>I'm a computer sciences student from Hasselt, Belgium.</h1>
<h1>Currently i'm working on this portfolio as a sort of side project.</h1>
<p>I describe myself as eclectic, which hopefully you'll be able to tell when looking at this website.</p>
<p>This portfolio is still a WIP, so until i'm satisfied with it you'll have to bare with me</p>

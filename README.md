# Personal Website project WIP
the intention of this is to become sort of personal portfolio, containing information about me as a person as well as my interests and work ethics. I'm still new to this, as you'll be able to tell, so in case you stumble upon this randomly just ignore it.

## Goals
- multiple pages with different layouts
- usage of pictures/videos
- links to social media
- ThreeJS implementation
- easily updateable

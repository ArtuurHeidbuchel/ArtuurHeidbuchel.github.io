# Personal Website project
the intention of this github repository is to be a sort of practicing canvas for to learn making my own website. I'm still new to this, as you'll be able to tell, so in case you stumble upon this randomly just ignore it.

## Goals
- multiple pages with different layouts
- usage of pictures/videos
- links to social media
- ThreeJS implementation
- easily updateable

# Hello and welcome!
# I'm Artuur HeidbÃ¼chel.

## I'm a Computer Sciences student from Limburg, Belgium. Currently, I'm still deciding in which subfield I'm going to specialise.

Some related topics that I care about are:

* The evolution of AI-systems and how they effect our work enviroment.
* A more centralised Europe with better co-operation with, as a result, more efficient investments in technological innovation. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
* [Anti-Consumerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-consumerism): I hope to create technology that can last and, if needed, can be updated to suit the needs of the user. [Right-to-Repair](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_1794) is something I'm adamant about as well as buying second hand items.
* Data privacy and the individual's rights to data protection.

For more information about myself as a person such as hobbies and interests I suggest going to the [AboutMe](aboutme.html) page. For inquiries I can always be contacted on my e-mail: heidbuchelartuur@gmail.com.
